# OSC-Herbarium Analysis
This is a quick exploratory analysis of the OSC herbarium.

I downloaded the OSC Vascular Plants native dataset from [pnwherbaria.org](http://www.pnwherbaria.org/data/datasets.php). Interestingly, this dataset actually included mosses, so I filtered those out (their sampling was quite spotty). I also filtered records to include only those with relatively accurate locations, IDed to species, and with at least the year recorded.

That left me with about 111,000 specimens. 

For comparison, I pulled all vascular plant data for Oregon from iNaturalist, excluding cultivated records.
